# What It Does
This application serves as a dedicated tool for inventory management, specifically designed for tracking the inventory of computers and peripherals supported by the EUC department. It offers robust integration with Excel for efficient data storage and manipulation.

## Unique Identifier Management
The application allows for the addition and removal of items based on unique identifiers (SAN numbers), ensuring these identifiers remain unique within the inventory system.

## Inventory Visualization
Users can view and update inventory levels through a user-friendly GUI. Inventory data is displayed in a tree view, facilitating easy visualization and interaction.

## Excel Integration
The application seamlessly integrates with Excel for data storage and manipulation, capable of creating an Excel workbook if none exists or loading an existing one to update inventory. This functionality extends to managing item counts, adding new items, and logging timestamped actions for inventory changes.

## Custom Dialogs
Several custom dialog windows are included for entering specific information such as SAN numbers, serial numbers, and related ServiceNow ticket numbers. This feature ensures data integrity and ease of use.

## Logging Actions
Every inventory change, whether an addition or subtraction, is logged with timestamps. These logs include the action taken and the item affected, providing a transparent history of inventory adjustments.

## Spreadsheet Management
Users have the capability to open the inventory spreadsheet directly from the application. This provides detailed views and allows for manual adjustments, offering flexibility in how inventory data is accessed and edited.
